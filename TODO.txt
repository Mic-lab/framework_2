NOTE: 
- Update comment in particle function

Optional:
- Particle
  - Add random range to particles initial position
  - Add hue shift
  - Have the particle's glow alpha attribute affect the glow's alpha when used in a 
    particle. At the moment, it's determined by the particles alpha value
  - Caching:
      - Add Angle initial value and angle_change, to have a constant angle change 
      frame
      - Cache angle image
      - Add glow
          - Bliting is faster then drawing a circle, so I should blit an image.
          But to blit, the scale must be right, so I'd need to transform the surface 
          (image). Therefore, This will require caching.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give particle new attribute for the glow's special flag

for x and y axis -> flip and offset
Give attributes rect and vel to Entity
Reduce "data/scripts/config.json" repetition
Fix globals with font databases
Capitalize constants
Implement button class

font_database can only be accessed from the file at which it's created
